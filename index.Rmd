[I](about_me.html) am an incoming first year PhD candidate in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health. I graduated from Smith College in Northampton, MA in May 2022 with a B.A., where I double majored in Mathematics and Statistical & Data Sciences. I received Highest Marks on my Statistical & Data Sciences Departmental Honors Thesis, entitled "Improving Mutational Signature Detection in Cancer through Frequentist and Bayesian Hypothesis Testing." I am interested in statistical genetics and developing statistical models to work with large-scale genetic and genomic data.
